### Abstract
Ugh, CSS, it seems like it has a mind of its own and gets overwhelming when you use it for anything more than a simple layout. Sometimes, it feels like you’re just guessing on what property to use and hoping for the best. You might feel intimidated and find yourself needing a front end developer to make even tiny changes to your site. In this presentation, I’ll help you tame that CSS beast and discuss tips and tricks for getting your site to look exactly right the first time. I’ll explain common misunderstandings about CSS and show you that, no, CSS isn’t that scary.

This talk assumes a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and is aimed at developers who know just enough about CSS to feel frustrated.
