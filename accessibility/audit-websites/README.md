### Abstract
What if you launched your awesome new website, but twenty percent of your visitors couldn't use it? That's not hyperbole, roughly 1 in 5 Americans with a disability that impacts their ability to use the web. We as developers owe it to our users to make sure that our sites are accessible for users with disabilities, but where do we start? In this workshop, Stephanie will explain how we measure and evaluate for accessibility and guide you through the process of auditing a website.
