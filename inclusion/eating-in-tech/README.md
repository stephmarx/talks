### Abstract
It's your first day at your new job, and your new boss and the CEO are taking you out for lunch. You want to make a good impression, and to do that you need to eat food around people. You, though, have an eating disorder. You can't just not go and you don't want anyone to learn about your disordered eating. What do you do? In this talk, I'll discuss my experiences as a person with disordered eating in an industry that seems to revolve around food. I'll explain the problems people with eating disorders face with lunch and learns, drinks after work, and interview lunches and provide actionable ways for everyone to make space to help us.
